Hierarchical bayesian models for sequential decision tasks

This repository includes code for two models of human data from sequential decision making tasks (e.g., bandit tasks)-- the expectancy valence model (Busemeyer and Stout, 2002) and the strategy shift expectancy valence model (Luthra and Todd, 2019). The models are fit to data via hierarchical bayesian modelling using JAGS in R. The DBDA2E code is taken from Kruschke (2014) and can also be found here: https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/software-installation.

Originally, these models were used to fit data from the probability matching task. Paper resulting from this modelling can be found here: https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2019/papers/0141/index.html. Please cite the paper if using the SS-EVL model.
